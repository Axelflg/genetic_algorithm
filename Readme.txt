NOTES
Before to execute genetic_algorithm.py you should have the following
2 json files on your folder:
- puntos_de_interes.json
- voronoi.json

These files were generate by data_processing.py program. 

Also, you need to install some dependencies to run it successfully: 
- numpy
- geopandas
- matplotlib
- folium
- deap

The genetic algorithm optimizes the points of interest calculating the fitness
for each population's individual based on population, traffic, tweets and time data.

The genetic algorithm generates 4 files:
- grafica_fitness_XXX.png: Show the fitness max evolution throught generations. 
- logbook_XXX.json: Contains the statistics of evolution.
- estaciones_de_recarga_XXX.json: Result of genetic algorithm.
- valencia_XXX.html: To visualize charging stations and voronoi json files on a web map. 

*** If you have problems running the genetic algorithm is probably because
the files puntos_de_interes_json and voronoi.json generated by data_processing program
have a special enconding that geopandas can't read correctly. To solve it just open
the files on Sublime Text -> File -> Save with Encoding -> UTF-8. Run it again. ***
