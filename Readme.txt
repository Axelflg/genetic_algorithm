NOTES
Before to execute genetic_algorithm.py you should have the following
2 json files on your folder:
- puntos_de_interes_json
- voronoi.json
These files were generates by data_processing.py program.
Also, you need to install DEAP library dependency in your Python environment.

The genetic algorithm optimizes the points of interest calculating the fitness
for each population's individual based on population, traffic, tweets and time data.
The genetic algorithm generates 3 json files:
- grafica_fitness_XXX: Show the fitness max evolution throught generations. 
- logbook_XXX: Contains the statistics of evolution.
- estaciones_de_recarga_XXX: Result of genetic algorithm.

*** If you have problems running the genetic algorithm is probably because
the files puntos_de_interes_json and voronoi.json generated by data_processing program
have an special enconding that geopandas can't read correctly. To solve it just open
the files on Sublime Text -> File -> Save with Encoding -> UTF-8. Run it again. ***
